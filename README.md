# Smart CSS Preprocessor
Smart CSS Preprocessor (SCP) is a new CSS preprocessor that makes writing stylesheets easier.
### Another stylesheet preprocessor? Why do I need it?!
Because SCP envolves concepts of other languages like Sass, LESS and Stylus, and has features that other projects don't have. It is moving in two directions. At the one side, it gives more freedom and uses such elements of high-level programming languages like variables, functions, mixins, logical and mathematical operators, conditional constructions, cycles and many more. At the another side, it helps to create complicated interfaces without writing a lot of code. *This text needs to be continued, but I am too busy to finish it now :)*
